MARIO Game:
MARIO is a game that I designed and developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective of the game is for the player to control the character MARIO, who starts from the beginning of the level and must reach the princess at the end of the level without coming into contact with any obstacles or enemies. As the player progresses through the levels, the complexity of the game increases, making it more challenging and exciting.
